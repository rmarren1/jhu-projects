# REPL-FINAL
## Final project for Representation Learning (600.479) at JHU.

Using the ABIDE pre-processed fMRI images, we are attempting to find representations of neural activity which are a good metric for differentiating between subjects with and without Autism Spectrum Disorder.

ASD is hypothesised to be characterized by local hyper-connectivity and global hypo-connectivity of neural citcuitry. We are looking to build algorithms to provide evidence for or against this claim.
